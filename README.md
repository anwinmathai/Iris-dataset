# Iris-dataset
To learn through datascience tools about the iris dataset.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set refers to it.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). 
Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters. 
Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other. 
The features are petal_length,petal_width,sepal_length and sepal_width with corresponds to them respectively in centimeters.
